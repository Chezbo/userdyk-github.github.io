**Approach extracting specific components of a chart and does not extract raw data**

- Extraction of simple graphical entities from SVG images in PDF for chart classification ｜ [[PDF]][2]
- Web crawler that collects and classifies SVG images using image elements ｜ [[PDF]][3]
- The Hough transform algorithm to extract information from bar charts, even hand-drawn ones ｜ [[PDF]][4]
- Extraction of information from additional chart types, including pie charts and line charts ｜ [[PDF]][5]
- Extraction of data tables from raster images for accessibility use and SIGHT generates summary of a simple bar chart for visually impaired users
- A system that transforms gray scale charts into XML format
- The performance of these systems can be improved with human guidance, as demonstrated by the ChartSense tool
- Extraction of information from certain charts
- Extraction of data from existing raster chart images and generates interactive animated visualization
- ReVision, to classify images of charts into five categories and extract data from bar charts and pie charts
- An automatic pipeline for extracting a visual encoding specification given a raster chart image
- Recovering the color mappings of charts that include a color legend

**Automatic pipeline for three types of charts and utilize state-of-the-art modules based on deep neural networks**
